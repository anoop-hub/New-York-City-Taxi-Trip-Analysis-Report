Screening Task
Please find the screening task attached. The task will demonstrate some familiarity with data processing and data visualization.The candidates will send us an Jupyter notebook (*.IPYNB) file which we can open using Visual Studio code with Jupyter extension.

Expected time to complete: 30-60 min.

Objective
- Create a Jupyter notebook to perform data manipulation, understanding, and visualization on the NYC Taxi Trip Duration dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data)

Data Manipulation and Understanding
- Utilize the Pandas library in Python to load and conduct an initial exploration of the NYC Taxi Trip Duration dataset: 
- Summarize your findings, focusing on the dataset's structure, presence of missing values, and the data types of various columns.

Data Visualization and Analysis
Create three distinct types of graphs using Matplotlib to highlight key observations from the dataset.
For each graph:
- Justify your choice of graph type for the data being represented.
- Discuss the insights or trends that the graph uncovers about the dataset.
- Ensure the graph is properly annotated with a clear title, axis labels, and a legend (if necessary).
